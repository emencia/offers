Web developer @ Emencia - Paris
===============================

We're small, fast, innovative and bursting at the seams with people passionate
about technology. We'd like to strengthen our team and we're seeking
enthusiastic, creative, intelligent, and fun individuals to join us in a
variety of roles. In return, we can offer you a fun but hard-working
environment where you can instantly see your contribution to the company's
success.  We are located in Paris (Bastille 75012) and work in a French and
English environment.

Web developer (Full stack or not)
=================================

We are looking for smart, self-motivated software developers to join our
development team. Good working TDD experience is a real plus for this role. A
passion for quality and testing is mandatory.

About you
---------
- You care about software; you have a passion for what you do which you can
  clearly convey by your actions rather than just waffly personal statements on
  your CV.
- You have an eye for software design and can talk eloquently on a range of
  topics due to your experiences and also from reading and experimentation.
- For you, it's more than a job.
- You contribute to the Open Source community, of course by sharing code but
  also by translating, testing, hosting events, writing doc or reporting bugs.

Testing
-------

Among others things we're strong advocates of testing. Testing guarantees
quality, easy collaboration and worry-free maintenance and upgrade. We expect
candidates to have knowledge with testing methodology.

If you do have working experience with testing, great!  We want to know more.
How much?  How did you write your tests? How have you used TDD on a recent
project? What problems have you faced? The more the better.

The role
--------

Our teams are project-oriented, self-organizing. You'll be working directly
with our Product Managers and stakeholders in a highly collaborative manners.
This approach requires a huge amount of teamwork and maturity and is not right
for everyone, but we believe it's the best way to create great software.

Projects address various concerns from client requirements to long term
architectural planning. You can fit in any project according to your skills and
wishes, bring your experience, and learn from your collaborators.

We expect our developers to deliver quality software. This is achieved by
reviewing each other's code using merge requests via Git. As such an automated
test and deployment suite is part of every project.

Among others things, Pair Programming, TDD/BDD, Refactoring and Continuous
Delivery are deeply embedded and we're constantly striving to improve the way
we work. Most of our processes are quite young and you would be able to
contribute very quickly for better approaches. We know typing is not the
bottleneck, so among others things:

- Daily meetings to share our discoveries and/or difficulties on the projects
  we're working on
- Weekly presentations on various subjects (new technology, a new package
  version release, new approaches, etc...)
- Regularly attend conferences and community events, both as participants and
  contributors (Djangocon, Django under the hood, PyconFR, EuroPython, meetups...)
- However we're far from perfection and are not afraid to say so. We recognize
  we have many problems which need solving and a long way to go on our journey
  of continuous improvement.

Technologies we use
-------------------
Most of our stack is Python/Django but we're using and investigating many other
languages and technologies (e.g. Javascript, Ruby, Go, Rust). We'd be
interested in candidates from any background as long as you have a keen
understanding of Object Oriented languages. Here's a (not exclusive) list of
technologies we currently use:

- Python, Django, Flask, Celery
- Selenium, pytest, sentry
- Javascript, jquery, vue.js, angular, react
- sass, Foundation and bootstrap
- Redis, Memcached, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ
- Postgresql, sqlite, mysql
- Git
- Ansible, Docker, Jenkins
- Nginx
- Rest, OAuth
- Slack, Breeze.pm

We're also very keen on open source. We contribute to some of the technologies
listed above as well as maintaining our own forks ( + publishing other things
we'd like to share) on our github and gitlab account.

Bonus
-----

- You can chose your work station (machine and OS)
- free coffee, drinks and fruits
- babyfoot
- no dress code
- Offices in a typical Haussman building
