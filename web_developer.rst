Web developer @ Emencia - Paris
===============================

We're small, fast, innovative and bursting at the seams with people passionate about technology. We'd like to strenghten our team and we're seeking enthousiastic, creative, intelligent, and fun individuals to join us in a variety of roles. In return, we can offer you a fun but hard-working environment where you can instantly see your contribution to the company's success.
We are located in Paris (Bastille 75012) and work in a french and english environment.

Web developer (Full stack or not)
=================================

We are looking for smart, self-motivated software developers to join our truly exceptional development team. Good working TDD experience is a real plus for this role. A passion for quality and testing is mandatory.

About you
---------

- You care about software; you have a passion for what you do which you can clearly convey by your actions rather than just waffly personal statements on your CV.
- You have an eye for software design and can talk eloquently on a range of topics due to your experiences and also from reading and experimentation.
- For you, it's more than a job.

TDD
---

Among others things we're strong advocates of TDD. We think it represents such a particular mindset we'd only consider you for a position if you have working experience with it or at least a really strong background on testing. If you do have working experience with TDD, great! We want to know more.
How much? How did you do TDD? How have you used TDD on a recent project? What problems have yo faced? The more the better.

The role
--------

Our teams are cross-functional, self-organizing, and highly autonomous. No architects or middle managers. You'll be working directly with our Product Managers and stakeholders in a hiighly collaborative manners. This approach requires a huge amount of teamwork and maturity and is not right for everyone, but we believe it's the best way to create great software.
Among others things, Pair Programming, TDD/BDD, Refactoring and Continuous Delivery are deeply embedded and we're constantly striving to improve the way we work. Most of our processes are quite young and you would be able to contribute very quickly for better approaches. We know typing is not the bottleneck, som among others things:
- Daily meetings to share our discoveries and/or difficulties on the projects we're working on
- Weekly presentation on various subjects (new technology, a new package version release, new approaches, etc...)
- Regularly attend conferences and community events, both as participnats and contributors (Djangocon, Django under the hood, Pyconfr, Pyconeu, meetups...)
- However we're far from perfection and are not afraid to say so. We recognize we have many problems which need solving and a long way to go on our journey of continuous improvements.

Technologies we use
-------------------

Most of our stack is Python/Django but we're using and investigating many other languages and technologies (e.g. Javascript, Ruby, Go, Rust). We'd be interested in candidates from any background as long as you have a keen understanding of Object Oriented languages. Here's a (not exclusive) list of technologies we currently use:
- Python, Django, Flask
- Selenium, pytest, sentry
- Javascript, jquery, vue.js, angular, react
- sass, Foundation and bootstrap
- Redis, Memcached, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ
- Postgresql, sqlite, mysql
- Git
- Ansible, Docker, Jenkins
- Nginx
- Rest, OAuth

We're also very keen on open source. We contribute to some of the technologies listed above as well as maintaining our own forks ( + publishing other things we'd like to share) on our github and gitlab account.

Bonus
-----
- You can chose your work station (machine and OS)
- free coffee, drinks and fruits
- babyfoot
- no dress code
- Offices in a typical Haussman building
